	<p>You spurn my natural emotions<br>
		You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt<br>
		And if I start a commotion<br>
		I run the risk of losing you and that's worse<br>
		Ever fallen in love with someone<br>
		Ever fallen in love, in love with someone<br>
		Ever fallen in love, in love with someone<br>
		You shouldn't have fallen in love with<br>
		I can't see much of a future<br>
		Unless we find out what's to blame, what a shame<br>
		And we won't be together much longer<br>
		Unless we realize that we are the same<br>
		Ever fallen in love with someone<br>
		Ever fallen in love, in love with someone<br>
		Ever fallen in love, in love with someone<br>
		You shouldn't have fallen in love with<br>
		You disturb my natural emotions<br>
		You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt<br>
		And if I start a commotion<br>
		I'll only end up losing you and that's worse<br>
