	<p>Oh life is bigger<br>
		It's bigger than you<br>
		And you are not me<br>
		The lengths that I will go to<br>
		The distance in your eyes<br>
		Oh no I've said too much<br>
		I set it up<br>
		That's me in the corner<br>
		That's me in the spot-light<br>
		Losing my religion<br>
		Trying to keep up with you<br>
		And I don't know if I can do it<br>
		Oh no I've said too much<br>
		I haven't said enough<br>
		I thought that I heard you laughing<br>
		I thought that I heard you sing<br>
		I think I thought I saw you try<br>
		Every whisper, of every waking hour<br>
		I'm choosing my confessions<br>
		Trying to keep an eye on you<br>
		Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool<br>
		Oh no I've said too much<br>
		I set it up<br>
		Consider this<br>
		Consider this the hint of the century<br>
		Consider this the slip<br>
		That brought me to my knees, failed<br>
		What if all these fantasies come<br>
		Flailing around<br>
		Now I've said too much<br>
		I thought that I heard you laughing<br>
		I thought that I heard you sing<br>
		I think I thought I saw you try<br>
		But that was just a dream<br>
		That was just a dream<br>
		That's me in the corner<br>
		That's me in the spot-light<br>
		Losing my religion<br>
		Trying to keep up with you<br>
		And I don't know if I can do it<br>
		Oh no I've said too much<br>
		I haven't said enough<br>
		I thought that I heard you laughing<br>
		I thought that I heard you sing<br>
		I think I thought I saw you try<br>
		But that was just a dream<br>
		Try, cry, fly, try<br>
		That was just a dream<br>
		Just a dream<br>
		Just a dream, dream</p>
