	<p>Reach out, touch faith<br>
		Your own personal Jesus<br>
		Someone to hear your prayers<br>
		Someone who cares<br>
		Your own personal Jesus<br>
		Someone to hear your prayers<br>
		Someone who's there<br>
		Feeling unknown<br>
		And you're all alone<br>
		Flesh and bone<br>
		By the telephone<br>
		Lift up the receiver<br>
		I'll make you a believer<br>
		Take second best<br>
		Put me to the test<br>
		Things on your chest<br>
		You need to confess<br>
		I will deliver<br>
		You know I'm a forgiver<br>
		Reach out, touch faith<br>
		Reach out, touch faith<br>
		Your own personal Jesus<br>
		Someone to hear your prayers<br>
		Someone who cares<br>
		Your own personal Jesus<br>
		Someone to hear your prayers<br>
		Someone who's there<br>
		Feeling unknown<br>
		And you're all alone<br>
		Flesh and bone<br>
		By the telephone<br>
		Lift up the receiver<br>
		I'll make you a believer<br>
		I will deliver<br>
		You know I'm a forgiver<br>
		Reach out, touch faith<br>
		Your own personal Jesus<br>
		Reach out, touch faith<br>
		Reach out, touch faith<br>
		Reach out, touch faith<br>
		(Reach out, reach out)<br>
		Reach out, touch faith<br>
		Reach out and touch faith</p>
